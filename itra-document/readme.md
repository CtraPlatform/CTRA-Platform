# 一、ITRA Points / Race evaluation

## 1、什么是 ITRA Points
ITRA Points (from 0 to 6) are a way to estimate the endurance difficulty of a race.  (However, they do not consider the technicality of the terrain)

ITRA points are awarded to runners finishing an ITRA Member race.
To be awarded, the race organizer (member) needs to upload a GPX file of the race from their organizer account.

ITRA Points are considered as a proof of a runner experience to achieve races of a certain difficulty.
Some race organizer require runners to show proof of experience by collecting iTRA points.

The organizer will require the runners to have obtained a defined number of ITRA points to be able to register to the race.
This system is often put in place by organizer to avoid beginner taking part into races they will probably not be able to finish, especially for longer distances or challenging races.



## 2、如何计算 ITRA Points

Please use our  Itra points calculator ([ITRA_POINTS_CALCULATION_en_es_fr.xlsx](ITRA_POINTS_CALCULATION_en_es_fr.xlsx) to simulate your race data and find out how many ITRA points your race will award.

For single race stage, (not a multistage race), ITRA uses a validated method to calculate the level of difficulty of a race and this method is based on the notion of ‘Km-effort’.
The total “Km-effort” of a race are calculated by taking into account both the distance and the elevation gain as follows:

For standard races

|Distance|Vertical|
|----------|----------|
|1km = 1 Km-effort|+100m vertical meters = 1 Km-effort|

Based on the number of Km-effort, each race is then classified according to its level of difficulty with ITRA Points ranging from 0 to 6 as follows:

Penalties

The number of Aid stations & Loops can have a direct impact over the calculation of km-effort and ITRA point.
If a race has a large number of aid stations in relation to the distance, it will be deemed to not require self-sufficiency and therefore, the number of effort points will be reduced.


Regarding Aid stations, the average interval between 2 aid stations is calculated as follows:

Distance = distance expressed in kilometers
Ascent gain/loss =a hundredth of the ascent expressed in meters
Number of aid stations =number of refreshment posts on the route (excluding start and finish line)

The average interval = Number of effort points / Number of aid stations

|Average Interval| Number of aid station penalty points |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
|Equal to or greater than 13| No aid station penalty points        |
|11.0 – 12.99| Minus 10 points                      |
|9.0 – 10.99| Minus 15 points                      |
|7.0 – 8.99| Minus 20 points                      |
|5.0 – 6.99| Minus 25 points                      |
|Less than 5| Minus 30 points                      |


Example:  40km / 1500m+ course with 6 aids stations:

> AI = (40+ (1500/100)) / 6 = 9.16   Penalty points = - 15 effort points.

Effort points final = 55 - 15 = 40 effort points.

This race course would obtain 1 ITRA points.
